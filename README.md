# Library-Management-System


## Description
This project implements a Library Management System using SQL to automate and streamline library operations. The system allows for efficient book issuance and categorization, enabling users to easily check book titles and availability. It maintains comprehensive records of books, including their titles, categories, rental prices, status, and availability. The system also tracks branch details, employees, and customers, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. SQL queries facilitate the management of these records, including adding, updating, and retrieving data. For instance, queries can list available books, categorize books, and update employee branch assignments. This system offers a user-friendly alternative to manual processes, enhancing the library's operational efficiency and user experience. The provided SQL code demonstrates the creation and manipulation of necessary tables and data, ensuring a robust and functional library management solution.
